{"name":"Python-Mini-Projects","tagline":"","body":"1. Memory Game :\r\n\r\n\tMemory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of \tcards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of \tthe player flipping over two cards. If they match, the \tplayer leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player \tflips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end \tup with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum \tnumber of turns. For this project, we will keep our model for Memory fairly simple. A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tInitial Phase :\r\n\t\r\n\t![alt tag](Memory-1.PNG )\r\n\t\r\n \r\n\r\n![alt](http://www.exuberantsolutions.com/course_logo/python-programming-assignment.png)\r\n\tFinal Phase :\r\n\t\r\n\t![alt tag](Memory-1.PNG)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
