## 1. Memory Game :

	Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of 	cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of 	the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the 	player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player 	flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end 	up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum 	number of turns. For this project, we will keep our model for Memory fairly simple. A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.

## 2.Blackjack Game :

Blackjack is a simple, popular card game that is played in many casinos. Cards in Blackjack have the following values: an ace may be valued as either 1 or 11 (player's choice), face cards (kings, queens and jacks) are valued at 10 and the value of the remaining cards corresponds to their number. During a round of Blackjack, the players plays against a dealer with the goal of building a hand (a collection of cards) whose cards have a total value that is higher than the value of the dealer's hand, but not over 21.  (A round of Blackjack is also sometimes referred to as a hand.)
