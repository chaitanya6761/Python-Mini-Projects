<p>Blackjack is a simple, popular card game that is played in many casinos.

<p>Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns.  A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.</p>

<p>iRobot is a company (started by MIT alumni and faculty) that sells the Roomba vacuuming robot (watch one of the product videos to see these robots in action).

In this Mini-Project  i coded small  simulation to show how a Roomba-like robot will clean the floor of a room using two different strategies.</p>
