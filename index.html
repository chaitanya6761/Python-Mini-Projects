<a id="blackjack-game" class="anchor" href="#blackjack-game" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BlackJack Game</h2>

<p>Blackjack is a simple, popular card game that is played in many casinos. Cards in Blackjack have the following values: an ace may be valued as either 1 or 11 (player's choice), face cards (kings, queens and jacks) are valued at 10 and the value of the remaining cards corresponds to their number. During a round of Blackjack, the players plays against a dealer with the goal of building a hand (a collection of cards) whose cards have a total value that is higher than the value of the dealer's hand, but not over 21.  (A round of Blackjack is also sometimes referred to as a hand.)</p>

<a id="memory-game" class="anchor" href="#memory-game" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Memory Game</h2>

<p>Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns.  A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.</p>

<p>iRobot is a company (started by MIT alumni and faculty) that sells the Roomba vacuuming robot (watch one of the product videos to see these robots in action). Roomba robots move around the floor, cleaning the area they pass over. In this Mini-Project  i coded small  simulation to show how a Roomba-like robot will clean the floor of a room using two different strategies.</p>
